After completing this project, I have a good understanding of Web Development. 
I have used HTML,CSS, and JS in this project. 
I have learned, how to use GSAP in this project.
This project is understood by me from the Sheriyans Coding School youtube channel.
This was really fun for me to create this project by writing each and every line by my hand and realizing the effects by changing the code.
Being a beginner, this is my second Web Dev project.
I know my abilities and hence I am working on them.
What I want to say to all- there is never too late, the thing matters is- Whether you start or not after realization.
Let's see what's next for me in my Web Development Journey.
